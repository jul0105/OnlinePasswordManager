## Package documentation

This crate has an online documentation available [here](https://jul0105.gitlab.io/SEC_Projet/sec_project/index.html).

You can also generate the documentation locally with the following command :

```
cargo doc --no-deps --open
```



## Specification

See `SPECIFICATIONS.md` (please open the PDF file if you don't use Typora)



## Implementation

We have not implemented access control because it didn't made much sense on our system but we have implemented registration of users.

Other cool things we implemented (Bonus ? :))

- User use 2FA authenticator to generate a Time-based One Time Password (TOTP).
- Trying to mitigate timing attack by making (sort of) time-constant server endpoint
- Using Diesel for DB management
